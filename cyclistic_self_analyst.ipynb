Cyclistic is a bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers\nwho purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.  \nThe director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore,my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve the recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.    \n\n\nThis project will be completed by using the 6 Data Analytics stages:  \n\nAsk: Identify the business task and determine the key stakeholders.  \nPrepare: Collect the data, identify how it’s organized, determine the credibility of the data.  \nProcess: Select the tool for data cleaning, check for errors and document the cleaning process.  \nAnalyze: Organize and format the data, aggregate the data so that it’s useful, perform calculations and identify trends and relationships.  \nShare: Use design thinking principles and data-driven storytelling approach, present the findings with effective visualization. Ensure the analysis has answered the business task.  \nAct: Share the final conclusion and the recommendations.  \n","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Ask:**  \n\nBusiness Task:  \nRecommend marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members by better understanding how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently.     \n\nStakeholders:  \nLily Moreno: The director of marketing and my manager.  \nCyclistic executive team: A detail-oriented executive team who will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program.  \nCyclistic marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic’s marketing strategy.
